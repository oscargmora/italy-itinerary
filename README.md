Live Demo --> https://oscargmora.github.io/italy-itinerary/

This is an itinerary for a trip to italy utilizing webpack to organize all the javascript files. Using this, it became easy to work through each tab separately, and format all pages the same way. This also helped me in learning about package.json, webpack configurations, using npm fluently, and so much more. See the demo for a better view of how this organization helped my work.
